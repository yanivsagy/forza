# Forza (Final Project for CPE203)
This is a single player car racing game against 3 CPU-controlled vehicles where the goal is to get to the finish line first while avoiding rolling barrels. In addition, the user can spawn motorcycles and oil puddles themselves to try to obstruct the path of the competition at the risk of obstructing their own path.
