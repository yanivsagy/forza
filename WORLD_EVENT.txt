WORLD EVENT:

1. How to trigger the event:
	
	The event is triggered by a mouse click on the racetrack at the beginning of the game. A maximum of two clicks is allowed before the player can start playing.

2. What should happen when the event is triggered:

	When the event is triggered, a motorcycle spawns where the mouse was clicked and oil hazards also spawn on two of the tiles next to where the mouse was clicked.
	The motorcycle will travel in the direction opposite to the direction the rest of the computer-controlled cars are travelling in.

3. What the affected entities should do:
	
	If a computer-controlled car collides with the motorcycle, the car will have trouble moving around it as it will try to block the car's path.

4. What the new entity is and how it should behave

	The new entity is a motorcycle. It moves along the track in the direction opposite to the direction the rest of the cars are travelling in.
	The motorcycle will interrupt the path of a nearby computer-controlled car which changes it's behavior by preventing the car from move past it.
